## PostgresSQL

# PgAdmin Errors:

## unrecognized configuration parameter *"lc_collate"*

* This indicates that there is an issue with the **configuration** of your PostgreSQL database.

In PostgreSQL, `lc_collate` is a parameter that defines the sort order for character strings. It determines how strings are compared and sorted in queries.

Here are a few steps you can take to address this issue:

1.  **Check PostgreSQL Version:** Ensure that you are using a version of PostgreSQL that supports the `lc_collate` parameter. This parameter has been present in PostgreSQL for a long time, so it's unusual for it to be unrecognized. However, it's possible that you are using an older version that doesn't support it.
    
2.  **Check Configuration Files:** Verify that the `postgresql.conf` file in your PostgreSQL installation contains an entry for `lc_collate`. If it's missing, you may need to add it.
    
3.  **Database Initialization:** If you recently initialized a new PostgreSQL database, it's possible that there was an issue during the initialization process that led to this error. You might want to **reinitialize the database**.
    
4.  **Reinstallation:** If none of the above steps work, consider **reinstalling PostgreSQL**. Sometimes, a corrupted installation can lead to strange errors.
    
5.  **Consult Documentation or Community Forums:** If the issue persists, consult the PostgreSQL documentation or community forums for more specific guidance related to your version and setup.
